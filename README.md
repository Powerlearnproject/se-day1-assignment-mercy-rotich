Cost and Time Efficiency: Systematic design and development approaches minimize rework and reduce development costs and time-to-market.
Security and Compliance: It incorporates security best practices and regulatory compliance, protecting user data and ensuring legal adherence.
Collaboration and Team Coordination: Structured methodologies (e.g., Agile, Scrum) enhance collaboration among cross-functional teams, leading to better project management and communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s)

Description: Structured programming was introduced to enhance readability, maintainability, and reliability in software development by promoting the use of clear control structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines.
Impact: It marked a shift away from unstructured "spaghetti code," paving the way for better-organized codebases and reducing software complexity.
Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)

Description: Object-oriented programming (OOP) introduced the concept of encapsulating data and behavior into objects, promoting code reusability and modularity.
Impact: OOP revolutionized software design by making it easier to model real-world entities, leading to more maintainable and scalable systems. Languages like C++, Java, and later Python popularized this paradigm.
Adoption of Agile Methodologies (2000s)

Description: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), promoted iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility in requirements.
Impact: Agile transformed the software development process by emphasizing adaptability and continuous delivery, enabling teams to respond to changing requirements more effectively and improving product quality through incremental updates.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Involves defining the project scope, objectives, and resources. It includes feasibility analysis and risk assessment to ensure the project is viable.
Requirements Analysis: Gathering and analyzing user requirements to understand the desired functionalities and constraints of the software.
Design: Creating architectural blueprints and detailed designs for the system, including database structures, user interfaces, and module interactions.
Implementation (Coding): Actual development of the software by writing code based on the design documents.
Testing: Verifying and validating the software through various testing methods to identify and fix defects.
Deployment: Releasing the finished product to the users or production environment.
Maintenance: Involves bug fixes, updates, and enhancements to improve performance and accommodate changing user needs.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Approach: Waterfall is a linear and sequential methodology where each phase is completed before the next begins, while Agile is iterative and incremental, allowing for continuous development and feedback throughout the project.

Flexibility: Waterfall is rigid and difficult to change once a phase is completed, whereas Agile is highly adaptable, allowing for changes and refinements at any stage of the development cycle.

Customer Involvement: In Waterfall, customer involvement is minimal after the requirements are defined, but in Agile, customers are actively involved throughout the development process, providing continuous feedback.

Delivery of Product: Waterfall delivers the final product only at the end of the development cycle, whereas Agile delivers small, working increments of the product regularly, usually at the end of each sprint.

Testing Phase: In Waterfall, testing is done after the implementation is complete, but in Agile, testing is continuous and happens alongside development to catch defects early.

Documentation: Waterfall emphasizes comprehensive documentation at every phase, while Agile focuses more on working software and keeps documentation light and flexible.

Team Collaboration: Waterfall projects typically involve isolated teams working on specific phases, whereas Agile promotes cross-functional team collaboration and daily meetings (e.g., stand-ups) to ensure effective communication.

Risk Management: In Waterfall, risks are identified early but can be costly to address later, while Agileâ€™s iterative approach allows for continuous risk assessment and mitigation throughout the project.
